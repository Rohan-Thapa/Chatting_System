# Chatting_System
Chatting system is one of the project of my 1st semester project for my course work. I had been working in the conncection of the systems and learnt various ways communication between devices through mostly throught the vidoes of Ben Eater in YouTube. 

There might be some problems in the system. Mostly, most of the error are managed but some which can't be solved by programming for the system are:
- Port unavailable in the system or busy port due to other communication channel using it.
- Usage of older version of Python in the code.
- Older version of processor with less cores due to use of threads. There should be the number of cores as there are threads in program.
